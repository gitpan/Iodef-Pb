Iodef-Pb
========

This library maps IODEF (RFC 5070) to the google protocol buffer serialization library. The lib/Iodef/_Pb.pm file is generated using Google::ProtocolBuffers library based on iodef.proto (github.com/collectiveintel/IODEF). This lib should only be used for low level API access. High level API access can be leveraged via the Iodef::Pb::Simple API. 

Once the buffer's are encoded, they can easily be transported via REST, ZeroMQ, Crossroads.io or any other messaging framework (or the google protocol RPC bits themselves). To store these in a database, you can easily base64 the data-structure and save as text.
